# QR Code Generator

This application allows users to generate QR codes for sharing essential information. You can create QR codes for either the Fonepay network or ConnectIPS. Please note that this application is not a replacement for the native QR codes provided by respective merchants, nor is it intended to serve that purpose. 

The goal of this project is to facilitate the easy sharing of bank details and simplify the money transfer process via QR codes, eliminating the need to manually input information.

**Disclaimers:**

1. Any disputes arising from the use of these QR codes are the sole responsibility of the user, and I will not be liable for any issues that may occur.

2. The information encoded in the QR codes is provided by the user. I do not verify the accuracy or validity of this information and cannot be held responsible for any errors or misrepresentations.

3. This application does not guarantee the security of transactions made using the generated QR codes. Users should exercise caution and verify all details before proceeding with any financial transactions.

4. By using this application, you acknowledge and accept these terms and conditions.
